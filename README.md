# CovidDataDashboard

Hi, This was my first DataVis project. I decided to do it in two parts.
* Using SQL and Tableau
* Using Python and StreamLit

As of this update, I have completed the first portion. The Data and SQL queries are available in the repo, while Public Tableau Dashboard is available at this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pranjal.roy.vishvakarma/viz/CovidDashboard_16733404856050/CovidDataDashboard)

## TODO: Python&StreamLit ver.
